# CIND820 Capstone Project - Twitter Sentiment Analysis


More than 7 billion people use the Internet and currently produce 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day (Marr, 2021). A large portion of this data is created on social media platforms. On Twitter, 456 thousand tweets are sent every minute (Marr, 2021). Sentiment analysis on these tweets can be conducted to understand people’s opinions, thoughts, feelings and impressions on all kinds of topics, products, and services. For example, businesses can use sentiment analysis to quickly understand customer attitudes towards their products and react accordingly, and governments can gauge public opinion to better strategize and plan for future policies. 

People’s emotions can be determined by classifying the polarity of their tweets using a variety of machine learning techniques. This project aims to perform sentiment polarity analysis by implementing both supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches to evaluate whether a tweet reflects a positive, negative or neutral sentiment.

The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle. It contains tweets with existing sentiment labels (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/data). There are 27481 tweets in the training set and 3534 tweets in the test set. 

The following methodologies will be employed to predict the sentiment of a tweet: Gradient Boost, XGBoost and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification models. This project will also build and train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to automatically learn tweet emotion. The outcomes of these models will be compared to investigate the best method of correctly predicting the sentiment of a tweet. This project will use the Python programming language.
